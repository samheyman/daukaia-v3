        <p>
          We need passionate, innovative individuals like you to join us as
          Ambassadors, volunteers or donors. Whether through a bake sale, a
          creative project, or spreading our mission, your unique talents and
          efforts can light up the path to a brighter future for a child. Maybe
          you want to involve your class, your company or a group of friends?
        </p>
        <p>
          Your support empowers children like Betty to build better lives for
          themselves and their families by providing the safety, skills, and
          mindset they need to follow their dreams and contribute positively to
          the world.
