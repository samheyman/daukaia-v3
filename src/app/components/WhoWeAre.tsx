          We are a small volunteer-run organization led by a school teacher in
          Norway, and with a small, passionate team on the ground.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg md:text-base my-4">
          We believe in the transformative power of community, and foster
          long-term impact through a holistic, grassroots approach that combines
          education, empowerment, and sustainable practices.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg md:text-base my-4">
          And, of course, weâ€™re able to do this thanks to the kind donations
          from people who choose to care and lend a helping hand. With your help
          we can truly make dreams come true.
